## PRÊT-À-LOGER
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app for the Prêt-à-loger innovaton project from Daniel Sánchez. No other template was used for this project. The webpage was designed from scratch, with the main structure and styling crafted by the creator. For certain aspects, assistance was provided by the ChatGPT-3.5 AI tool.

## Features
Next.js Framework
This project uses Next.js, a powerful React framework for building scalable, high-performance web applications with features like:

1. File-based routing
Server-side rendering (SSR)
Static site generation (SSG)
API routes
Custom Design

The webpage’s primary design, including layout, color scheme, and interactive elements, was conceptualized and implemented by the creator. 

2. 3D Animation with Three.js
For the interactive 3D animation, Three.js was utilized. Three.js is a JavaScript library that enables the creation of complex 3D graphics and animations directly in the browser. Key features of the 3D animation include:

Dynamic interactions: Users can interact with the 3D model, zoom in on specific elements, and view animations.
Realistic rendering: Textures and materials add depth and detail to the 3D objects.

3. Images and Visual Elements
The images used throughout the project are a mix of original photographs created by the author and assets sourced from multiple platforms. All images are used for illustrative purposes, ensuring the webpage conveys its intended message effectively.

4. Tools and Technologies
Next.js: For building the webpage and handling routing, rendering, and API endpoints.
React.js: For creating dynamic, reusable components and managing the UI.
Three.js: For rendering and animating 3D models in real time.
CSS Modules: For scoped styling of components.
AmbientCG: For high-quality material downloads.
AI Assistance (ChatGPT 3.5): Used for debugging and enhancing parts of the code and design.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
